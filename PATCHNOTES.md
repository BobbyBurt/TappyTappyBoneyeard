## Version 23 (patch 1) - Nov 10 2023

### Changed

- Removed level 9 tutorial text.
- Adjusted the award score milestones for level 15, 16 and 22. Awards earned on old save files may change as a result.
- Corrected an error in one of the hints.
- Fixed an issue where recently unlocked levels weren't included in autosaves, which could cause a softlock.

Thanks to NG commentors for calling attention to these issues. More patches to follow.
